# 👋 Hi, I'm Juan Jose Jaramillo Mora

🎓 Systems and Computing Engineering student at **Universidad EIA**  
💻 Focused on **software development**, **backend systems**, and **data-oriented solutions**

I am interested in understanding how software systems work end-to-end, from backend logic and APIs to data persistence and system structure. I focus on building clean, maintainable, and scalable solutions, applying good software engineering practices.

Currently, I am strengthening my foundations in backend development, databases, and software architecture, while exploring how modern technologies such as artificial intelligence can be applied to real-world systems.
